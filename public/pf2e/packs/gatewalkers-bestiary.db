horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>","source":{"author":"","value":"Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":9}},"traits":{"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common","elven","sylvan"]},"rarity":"common","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["beast"]},"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.gatewalkers-bestiary.EfoaqozIWUdm8unh"}}}

Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate.

In recent years, corrupting magic has given it additional, stranger powers.</p>\n<p>When you wear and invest the <em>Shadewither Key</em>, shadows gather around you. You gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks. However, this boon comes with great risk: any elf who touches the <em>Shadewither Key</em> is immediately afflicted with the obnubilate curse (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You touch the <em>Shadewither Key</em> and command the shadows it casts around you to peel away. The shadows form an umbral double that resembles you in every way except for its fiery red eyes and the expression of wicked delight on its face. The double occupies the same space as you and attempts to intercept any attacks aimed at you. A creature must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11] when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect; on a failure, they hit the shadowy double instead of you. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the double is hit, whichever comes first. Once the double is hit, it's destroyed. As long as the double exists, you don't gain the <em>Shadewither Key's</em> item bonus to Stealth checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> The <em>Shadewither Key's</em> magic can be destroyed by exposing the artifact to uncontained teleportation energies. If touched to an unlinked or malfunctioning aiudara, the <em>Shadewither Key</em> causes the gate to connect to a new counterpart. If this happens, the key's magic leaves it, rendering the item useless.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Obnubilate Curse</strong></p>\n<p>Only elves can be afflicted with this magical curse; other creatures are immune. An elf who touches the Shadewither Key must save against the curse. Victims quickly fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}; then, over several days, they slowly blacken and shrivel like rotting fruit until they die. The corpse of an elf killed by the obnubilate curse is dry and charcoal-like; it collapses into ash at the slightest touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:27|traits:curse,enchantment,incapacitation,magical,mental,shadow|overrideTraits:true]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> unconscious and [[/r 3d6[mental]]] (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]] (2 days)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]] (2 days)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]], permanent loss of most recent year of memory (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]], permanent loss of all memory (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 6</strong> death.</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"hardness":0,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":22},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"price":{"value":{}},"quantity":1,"rules":[],"size":"med","slug":"shadewither-key","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch"},"stackGroup":null,"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"unique","value":["artifact","cursed","illusion","invested","primal"]},"usage":{"value":"worn"},"weight":{"value":"-"},"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"equipment"},{"_id":"gNZND9cktvmWzCUJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["shadowfeed"]},"bonus":{"value":14},"damageRolls":{"2EOkIWCkJj7TDpfe":{"damage":"1d6+1","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"melee"},{"_id":"eEJbnRRJjKe1QZrQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Phasic Defenses","sort":600000,"system":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Kaneepo hasn't Slimstepped since the beginning of their last turn</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Kaneepo would take damage from an attack</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Kaneepo Slimsteps, taking no damage if their new square would move them out of the range or area of the attack.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.815,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"action"},{"_id":"snnkc1WVmU7H0RQm","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Create Breach","sort":700000,"system":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>Once per day, Kaneepo can tear open the fabric between planes, creating a portal between the Thinlands and a point anywhere in Sevenarches.
